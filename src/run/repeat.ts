 * OBSERVATION (what happened), this is the POLICY judgment (pass or fail against a threshold), the same
 * split `computeVerdict` draws between recorded facts and pass/fail.
 *
 * `stoppedEarly:"diverged"` always fails regardless of the numeric rate — divergence (both a pass AND a
 * fail observed) IS the failure `--stop-on-diverge` exists to catch. `stoppedEarly:"unanswered"` also
 * always fails — an unanswered gate mid-batch means the scenario itself isn't fully scripted for
 * deterministic repetition, which is the real problem `--repeat` exists to surface, not noise to average
 * away against whatever completed cleanly beforehand. `stoppedEarly:"error"` (an uncaught exception —
 * a BoundaryError or any other error mid-batch) always fails for the same reason: a batch that couldn't
 * finish because something broke is a real failure, not a clean-but-incomplete measurement.
 * `stoppedEarly:"budget"` defaults to failing too — a budget cutoff means the batch never reached
 * `requested`, so a clean-looking passRate over a small completed prefix is "incomplete is not green",
 * the same principle `--matrix`'s `truncated` applies. Pass `allowBudgetStop: true` to opt back into the
 * old behavior (judge a budget-stopped batch on its own completed-runs passRate like any other batch —
 * an incomplete-but-clean run isn't itself a failure, that's a `::warning::` at the call site instead).

/**
 * The batch's ARM, as a suffix for the rollup verdict line — `""` for a normal batch.
 *
 * `--ablate-skill --repeat N` produces N control runs and zero treatment runs. That is correct for a
 * single-arm flag, and the rollup reported it as `repeat "<skill>": PASS — 5/5 passed (100%)`, which a
 * consumer read as a completed A/B twice (10 baseline runs, 0 treatment runs, ~$16) before catching it
 * at analysis. The per-run `[provenance]` banner now says `ablated=true` on each run, but a batch is
 * exactly where per-run output scrolls past — the rollup line is the one people read, so the arm has to
 * be ON it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a refusal of the flag combination. Ablation genuinely takes effect here (unlike
 * `--ablate-skill --resume`, which execute.ts rejects because the skill stays mounted and `ablated:true`
 * would be a lie), and "how variable is my no-skill baseline?" is a real question these flags compose
 * correctly to answer. The output was honest and unlabeled, so the fix is the label.
 *
 * A PARTIALLY ablated batch is named as mixed rather than rounded to either arm: no flag produces one
 * today, but a resumed or hand-assembled run set could, and it is interpretable as neither arm.
