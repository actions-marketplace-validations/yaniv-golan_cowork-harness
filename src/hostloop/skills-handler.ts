/**
 * The `skills` sdk-MCP server, driver-side — models the Desktop-side skill-discovery surface a real
 * cowork-lane session (container/hostloop) declares alongside `workspace`/`cowork`: `list_skills`
 * (always) and `suggest_skills` (gated). Binary-verified (2026-07-24 confirmation pass, app.asar
 * 1.24012.1 — see the A2 confirmation doc's §4/§5/§6): the tool inventory, both inputSchemas, both gate
 * ids (`suggestSkillsEnabled:245679952`, `proactiveSkillSuggestEnabled:1598976391`) and their effect on
 * the tool set, and the output envelope's field set + branch structure (the `note` variants, the
 * `.slice(0,15)` cap on `suggest_skills.resolved_skills`) are ALL pinned to the extracted asar. One
 * exception: `list_skills.resolved_skills`'s PER-ITEM shape was opaque in the extraction (confirmation
 * doc §6) — we mirror `suggest_skills`'s confirmed `{name,description,skill_id,is_user_created}` item
 * shape here, so treat that per-item shape as inferred, not binary-verified. The tool
 * DESCRIPTION strings below are a faithful prose reconstruction assembled from the confirmed semantic
 * fragments the extraction recovered (the routing rule, the fallback clause, the base-vs-proactive
 * split, the `search_plugins` nudge) — the recon recovered the meaning/structure but not a literal wire
 * byte-string, so treat the exact wording as harness prose, not a captured constant (the same caveat
 * `cowork-handler.ts` documents for `present_files`, for the analogous reason).
 *
 * Every tool is `_meta:{"anthropic/alwaysLoad":true}` — real Cowork reports these in the `system/init`
 * `tools` array from turn one (see `docs/fidelity-gaps.md`), not behind a ToolSearch `select:` round-trip.
 *
 * `resolved_skills`/`installed_plugins` are populated from the session's actually-mounted skills/plugins
 * (deterministic, run-derived — `listMountedSkills`/`mountedPluginsFromPlan`), never a live catalog call:
 * no network, no side effect, matching the harness's token-free posture for every other SDK-MCP stub.
 * `suggest_skills`'s `resolved_skills` is a deliberate exception — it always returns empty, because the
 * *addable* (not-yet-installed) catalog is Anthropic's live skill library, which this harness does not
 * model; an empty catalog with an honest `note` is the faithful stub (spec §6/§7), not a bug.
