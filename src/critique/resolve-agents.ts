/** Every agent the graded skill can dispatch, as its own corpus entry.

 *  resolve to LESS than the single `agents/<skillName>.md` the packager shipped before.
 *    1. `agents/<skillName>.md` by FILENAME — exactly what `agentsMdFor` did.
 *    2. every in-plugin agent a pinned `subagent_type` literal in SKILL.md / `references/**` resolves to.
 *    3. every agent whose DECLARED name equals the skill name — clause 1 is filename-keyed by necessity
 *       (it must reproduce the old behaviour byte-for-byte), so a plugin whose `agents/redteam.md`
 *       declares `name: market-sizing` and pins no literal was packaging NOTHING. That was a live defect
 *       at N=1, independent of the multi-agent gap.
 *
 *  Then a TRANSITIVE closure: an agent body that pins `subagent_type` dispatches that agent during the
 *  graded turn too, so its guidance is just as absent. Closing to a fixpoint over the resolved bodies
 *  fixes the headline defect at depth 2 instead of re-creating it one level down. `|agents|` bounds the
 *  loop and a visited set makes a dispatch cycle terminate.
 *
 *  NOT bounded from above by construction: a router-style skill pinning every agent resolves to the same
 *  set a blanket `agents/**` glob would. The 512 KiB corpus ceiling is the only backstop, and an agent
 *  file can now push SKILL.md into a cut — a new failure mode, made graceful (not cliff-edged) by the
 *  smallest-first allocator in `package-evidence.ts`. */
