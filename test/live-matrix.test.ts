/**
 * Live matrix tests (E3's own "optional live e2e", plus a regression pin for the Fable/Opus-found
 * "one cell's unanswered gate must not crash the whole matrix" bug; a live test for that specific bug
 * was originally deferred, then built here on request).
 *
 * `fidelity: protocol` (L0) needs NO Docker and NO staged agent — `spawnProtocol` spawns the HOST `claude`
 * from PATH (src/runtime/protocol.ts) and never calls `resolveAgentBinary`. So the gate probes the host
 * CLI + a live token, unlike test/live-contract.test.ts (which does need Docker + the staged binary).
 *
 * The baselines this file matrices over are axis VALUES, not binaries to run: at protocol fidelity they
 * select config, and nothing resolves a staged ELF for them.
 *
 * GATE HISTORY — read before "simplifying" this back. The gate used to require
 * `resolveAgentBinary(loadBaseline("desktop-1.18286.0"))` to exist, on the since-obsoleted reasoning that
 * both matrixed baselines pin the same staged agent (2.1.197) so only one binary would be needed. That
 * binary requirement was never real for this tier, and Desktop PRUNES old staged agents on update — so
 * once the machine moved past 2.1.197 the whole suite `skipIf`-ed itself out on every developer machine
 * and in CI, silently, for many releases. It was found only by auditing which suites a live run had
 * actually executed. Gate on what the tier genuinely uses, never on an incidental artifact.
 *
 * Run locally: CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.cowork-harness-token) vitest run --config vitest.config.live.ts live-matrix
