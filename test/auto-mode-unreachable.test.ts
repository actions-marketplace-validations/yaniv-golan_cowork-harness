/**
 * AUTO-MODE IS STRUCTURALLY UNREACHABLE — the load-bearing premise of the
 * "Auto-mode permission rubric is not modeled" gap (docs/fidelity-gaps.md).
 *
 * Why this needs a test rather than a doc sentence. The gap write-up rests the claim on "the harness
 * never constructs `settings.autoMode`". That is true but it is NOT the mechanism that makes the rubric
 * unreachable, and the weaker reading has a hole worth naming: the agent's
 * `AUTO_MODE_TRUSTED_SOURCES` is `["userSettings","flagSettings","policySettings"]` — **userSettings is
 * trusted** — and the harness passes `--setting-sources user`. So an operator's own settings ARE a
 * trusted source for auto-mode's allow/soft_deny/hard_deny/environment rules, and at protocol/hostloop
 * under OAuth the agent reads the operator's REAL config dir.
 *
 * What actually closes it (binary-verified, agent 2.1.237): auto-mode is entered on
 * `permissionMode === "auto"` alone —
 *
 *     if (e.permissionMode === "auto") r = fme(r)
 *
 * — so trusted SOURCES govern only where the rules would be read from, never whether the mode is on.
 * Two independent structural guards keep the harness out of it, and this file pins both, because each
 * is one edit away from silently disappearing:
 *
 *   1. the session schema's `permission_mode` enum has no "auto" member, so no scenario can ask for it;
 *   2. the argv builder's only sources for the flag are that session value and the baseline's pinned
 *      `spawn.permissionMode` — neither of which can be "auto".
 *
 * If a future release adds auto-mode support, these fail, and that is the point: the rubric's ~72 risk
 * categories (including the six `cowork_*` ones added in agent 2.1.237 — cowork_folder_access,
 * cowork_delete_grant, cowork_skill_persistence and the scheduled-task trio) become reachable the moment
 * the mode does, and the gap must be re-triaged before that ships rather than after.
