// ── T-G1: the replay-class buckets, guarded INDEPENDENTLY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//

// LIVE_ONLY_KEYS out entirely. A union cannot see a key MOVING between buckets — and the move is the
// change that matters, because the bucket is what tells an author whether their assertion survives a
// token-free replay or is silently skipped. Two real misclassifications were sitting behind that blind
// spot when this was written:
//
//   * `fidelity-and-answers.md` enumerated the live-only set and omitted `no_delete_in_mounts`, so a
//     reader counting on that list would expect it to replay.
//   * `scenario.py`'s scaffold emitted `file_exists`/`user_visible_artifact` under a heading reading
//     "LIVE-only (skipped on replay)". Both are MANIFEST_KEYS — they replay whenever the cassette
//     carries an artifacts manifest, which `record` has snapshotted since 0.24. The scaffold contradicted
//     the taxonomy in its OWN file, and taught the misconception the `manifest-needs-snapshot` INFO exists
//     to correct.
//
// The scenario.py check is deliberately a SELF-consistency check against that file's own sets, not a
// mirror of the TS constants: `scenario.py:67` says outright that it is "NOT a 1:1 mirror" (it keeps the
// verdict modifiers out of CONTENT_KEYS on purpose), so demanding equality would be wrong and would get
// worked around rather than fixed.
